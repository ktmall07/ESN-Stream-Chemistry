Honors Thesis Project exploring Reservoir Computing Applications for Watershed Health Prediction

Contains tests of various randomly initialized Echo State networks, and a vanilla LSTM model for comparison. Also proposes when one should be used over the other, and the broader use of ESN's in Streamflow problems.

This project makes use of the following python packages: 

tensorflow
reservoirpy
scalecast

Currently in the process of editing and revising a manuscript to be submitted to a journal. References cited in the manuscript are written below.
