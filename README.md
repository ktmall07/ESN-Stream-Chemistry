Project exploring Reservoir Computing Applications for Watershed Health Prediction

Contains tests on reservoir size, random initialization, data length/quality on Echo State Networks (ESN)s. The project directly compares ESNs to a vanilla Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, commonly used in streamflow/water quality forecasting, and provides a use case for when one might be a better choice than the other. The project also describes the broader use of ESN's in Streamflow problems, and their use in Machine Learning ensembles.

This project makes use of the following python packages: 

tensorflow
reservoirpy
scalecast
pandas
numpy
hydroeval
matplotlib

Provided in the repository are the scripts, datasets, and figures and results generated by the models. Also provided is the final manuscript submitted to the Journal of Hydroinformatics.
