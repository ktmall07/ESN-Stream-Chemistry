Honors Thesis Project exploring Reservoir Computing Applications for Watershed Health Prediction

Contains tests of various randomly initialized Echo State networks, and a vanilla LSTM model for comparison. Also proposes when one should be used over the other, and the broader use of ESN's in Streamflow problems.
