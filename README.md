Honors Thesis Project exploring Reservoir Computing Applications for Watershed Health Prediction

Contains tests of various randomly initialized Echo State networks, and a vanilla LSTM model for comparison. Also proposes when one should be used over the other, and the broader use of ESN's in Streamflow problems.

This project makes use of the following python packages: 

tensorflow
reservoirpy
scalecast

Provided in the repository are the scripts, datasets, and figures and results generated by the models. Also provided is the final manuscript submitted to the Journal of Hydroinformatics.
